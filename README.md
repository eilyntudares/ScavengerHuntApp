# Project 1 - ScavengerHuntApp

Submitted by: **Eilyn Tudares**

**ScavengerHuntApp** is an iOS app that lets users create scavenger hunt tasks, attach photos from their photo library, and visualize where each photo was taken on a map. Once a photo is attached, the task is marked as completed and the updated status is reflected on the task list.

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] App displays list of tasks
- [x] User can create new tasks dynamically
- [x] When a task is tapped it navigates the user to a task detail view
- [x] When user adds a photo to complete the task, it marks the task as complete
- [x] When adding photo of task, the location is added (if available from metadata)
- [x] User returns to home page (list of tasks) and the status of the task is updated to complete


The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Tasks persist locally using `UserDefaults`
- [x] Users can delete tasks from the list
- [x] Custom map annotations with pins
- [x] Minimal UI polish with SwiftUI

## Notes

One challenge was removing UIKit storyboard references so the app could launch purely in SwiftUI. Another was testing location metadata: most simulator images donâ€™t have GPS data, so I had to drag in real photos with metadata or run the app on a physical device to see pins on the map.
